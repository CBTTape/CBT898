   PM: Parmlib Member.
!y   ! y!      y!

   Display of the active parmlib members used in current IPL as
   extracted from the IPA control block.

   Parameters:
!g
     Positional:
!t
     - Can pass "member" as per presentation (cols 1-8).
!w     !         t     !
       Eg. "PM PROG" will display all members concatenated from
!           y      !
           appropriate dataset one at a time.
           Cursor placement on cols 1-8 of line (with PM on command
           line) will do the same as above. Cursor placement over
           member suffix (eg, over A1) will only present the
           member_suffix combo that the cursor is directly over.

     - Can also pass member suffix or wildcard using * or %.
!w     !                                             g!   g!
       Eg. "PM PROG A*". Note, the wildcarding is on the last 2 bytes
!           y         !
       only.
     Keyword:
!t
     /1 - Only display the first member from the parmlib
!    y  w!
          concatenation that would be used during the IPL.  Use this
          paramater when there are multiple datasets that may have
          common members. Eg. "PM PROG /1".
!                              y         !
     ?  - For this text as tutorial.  Tutorial needs routine "BR" to
!    y  w!                                                    p !
          be available.  If it is not, the error is trapped and the
          tutorial is presented is "red screen text".
!                                   r              !
