TERSE toggler.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$TT uses the IBM supplied Missing. to terse and unterse datasets.

This is ideal for large data transfrs between nodes or FTPing data.
A PDS source (eg. REXX) can compress down to less than 1/5 original
size. This same PDS will XMIT down to about 8/9 original, however, this
XMITed file when tersed will go down to less than 1/4 of the XMITted
file.  A typical load library will terse down to lss than 1/3 original
size.

For further deails on it's use, install as outlined below and enter
   "TSO $TT ?" on any ISPF command line.

To install the TERSE togler facility.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upload the XMITed file onto your MVS TSO session. Ensure the dataset
has minimum attributes of RECFM=FB,LRECL=80.

Under ISPF 3.4 issue command "RECEIVE INDA(/)" against your uploaded
dataset. Suggest you receive it into the default dataset.

If the IBM TRSAMIN program is not readily available at your site,
issue a refresh command and against the above (received into) dataset,
enter "RECEIVE INDA(/($TTLMOD))" to receive the program. Suggest it is
received into the default dataset.

If you used the default for both receives, no further action is
required otherwise you may need to change member $TTALLOC to reflect
new names (for option 1 only).

Option 1:
~~~~~~~~~
Exit ISPF into native TSO (READY prompt) and enter:
    EX 'userid.TERSE.REXX($TTALLOC)'

This command must be executed everytime you logon to TSO.
You may remove the concatenations without logging off by etering:
    EX 'userid.TERSE.REXX($TTALLOC)' 'MINUS'

Option 2:
~~~~~~~~~
Copy all members identified with 'R)' in member $TTINDEX into an
existing REXX dataset allocated to SYSEXEC. Note, REAL is not required
under this option (however, it is handy routine for other use).
Copy load module TRSMAIN either into an ISPLLIB concatenated dataset or
get it link listed (if not already).  Use should be immediate
(LLA REFRESH option as required).

To get further details on this facility enter "TSO $TT ?". Note REXX
program "BR" is used to trap the output and present under browser. This
facility can be used to trap any PUTLINE output unde ISPF, eg.
  "TSO %BR LISTCAT LEV('userid') ALL"

Once in ISPF you can go into ISPF 3.4 and enter "$TT" against any PO or
PS dataset or any (tersed) dataset with LRECL=1024.  Note, will not work
for PDSE or VSAM datasets (although PDSE has been allowed for in case
IBM update the terser).
