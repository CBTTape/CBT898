Use PDSEDIT to change all occurances of "BR(" to "$BR(" for sites that
already use "BR" to browse datasets as a load module in the ISPLLIB
concatenation.

Members:
--------
  $README  - Duh!!!
  BRFIX    - Batch JCL to do Global change.
  BRREP    - Batch JCL to do Global report.
  PDSDOCO  - Original PDSEDIT doco.
  PDSEDITL - XMITed PDSEDIT load module.

Fix procedure:
--------------
1. Receive SPFEDITL into any loadlib (let receive create it's own).
2. Modify JCL BRFIX to point to above loadlib and point to appropriate
   REXX PDS that may use the BR command.
   Submit JCL.
3. For some reason SPFEDIT reports line overflow (which does not seem
   correct), however look for the following eye catcher in the SDSF
   output:
       PDE0118  LINE OVERFLOW IN
   For those members you will need to manually modify "BR(" to "$BR(".
4. Set up $BR as an alias to BR (or copy BR into $BR, however, alias
   is better as it will be controlled by the system).
