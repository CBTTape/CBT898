+This facility has been developed to perform a member list comparison between
+two or more PDSs.  Data may be entered via a parameter PDS(member) or direct
+from screen input.
+
+Volsers must be supplied if the datasets are not catalogued on the executing
+system.
+
+This routine will compare the member list of the source datasets one by one
+with the member list of the destination datasets. A report will be generated on
+all the@HITS, MISSES+or@BOTH+.
+
+The parameter file must have a dataset on each line prefixed by@DSN=+. If the
+dataset is not catalogued, you may indicate the volser by supplying a
@VOL=SER=volume+as the next parameter on the line. The dataset name and volser
+may be seperated by space(s) or a comma. This data may be standard JCL,
+eg. DD concatenations.
