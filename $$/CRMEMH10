+You must specify the start line number of the source dataset and the end line
+number along with the start and end of the destination datasets. If only one
+dataset is desired both the start and end line numbers should be the same.  You
+may also specify a source and a destination volser. However, this will expect
+all source and all the destination datasets to be on the specified disks. Any
+in-stream@VOL=SER=+parameter will overwrite the supplied one for processing
+that dataset.
+
+It is not recommended that source and destination ranges overlap unless either
+a converse perspective is required or you are comparing datasets on different
+volumes.
+
+Be aware of output limitations. There is a limit to batch TSO displays (?
+value).
+
+You may edit the data dataset, under part 1, by entering@E+on the command line.
+A member list is provided unless the member is enterd.
