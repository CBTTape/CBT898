&Hello &CNAME..
!w

 This routine will permit you to transfer full datasets (sequential or PDS) or
 selected members from a PDS.

 The type of transfer is determided by the member list entry:
   blank - Will XMIT the entire dataset.
!y       w b    t   b
   ml    - Member list with members seperated by spaces.
!y       w b
   * | wildcard
!y   by
         - This will present a member selection list. If * is used, no members
!        w b                                             yb
           will be pre-selected. If you use a widcard (trailing *) all matches
!                                                               yb
           will be pre-selected. In either case you may manually change the
           selection as required. (See under member selection.)
           This function will build a member list that will be presented for
           confirmation.
=

 Invalid/deleted members will not be processed. The actual XMIT command will
!                                                          t   b
 perform the member list validation.

 Miscellaneous commands (in primary entry screen):
=y           wb
    B        - Browse dataset.
    E        - Edit dataset.
    REfresh  - Refresh member list from last non-blank execution member list.
    V        - View dataset.
=

 Miscellaneous flags:
  Repeat:
!g
    Repeat XMIT. This will redisplay the primary screen for parameter changing
    and additional XMITing.
  Terse out DSN:
!g
    Invoke the TT (Terse Toggler) command to terse the output. By default,
!              y b yb    yb
    '.TERSED' will be appended to the XMITed dataset to generate the tersed
!    w      b
    name. Set this flag to # to bring up the TT parameter entry screen.
!                          yb                y b
    (/# is the TT data entry screen display parameter.)
!    y  b      y b
  Batch:
!g
    Execute XMIT in batch. Generaly used to create JCL for later use.
  Notify:
!g
    XMIT facility will notify you when recipient receives data. (Should only be
    used for nodal XMITs.)

 In the member selection list you may execute the following commands:
=y       w b
  CAN    - Cancel out of the selection list.
  RESET  - Free block command situation created by first SS selection.
  SEL * / wildcard
!y
         - This will either select all members or if a mask is provided, tag all
           matches.
  SORT   - Sort on CHANGED, ID or MEMBER name. By default the sort is on MEMBER.
!y       w b       t      b t  b  t     b                                t     b
  USEL * | wildcard
!y       by
         - This will either select all or mathes with a mask.
=

 Additional commands for tailored selection (dates and userids must be in the
 same format as per display):
  D=date - Select all members changed on that date. The date may be any valid
!y       w b
           European date format. Incomplete dates will be expanded according to
           level of entry, eg if dd is entered the current /mm/yyyy will
!                                y b                       y        b
           automatically be appended. (The date will be reversed to format
           yyyy/mm/dd for comparison purposes.)
!t                    b
=y       w b
  D>date - Select all members changed after  specified date (fmt: D>dd/mm/yyyy).
  D<date - Select all members changed before specified date (fmt: D>dd/mm/yyyy).
  U=userid | U>userid
!y         by
         - Select all members that match the userid exectly. No wildcarding
            permitted. Use the > for not matching.
!                              yb

 In the member selection list you may execute the following selections:
!b
   B     - Browse member.
   E     - Edit member.
   S     - Select member for inclusion in XMIT list.
!y       w b                              t   b
   SS    - Block selection. No interim selections are permitted while scrolling
           screens. Use RESET command to drop blocking.
   U     - Unselect selected member.
   V     - View member.
   X     - Exclude member from member list.
=

 You must use your END PF key to process the member selection list. A input
!                  t  b
 protected screen will be presented for confirmation. This screen is protected
 as a long member selection list may not fit on the screen.
 Be careful if you end out of the confirmation panel you will loose all your
 previous selections.

 Helpfull hints:
  - You may XMIT VSAM files as follows:
!w b        t   b
    REPRO the VSAM file into a flat file and XMIT the flat file into a dataset
!   t    b                                   t   b
    specified in the Out_DSN field (this dataset does not have to be
!                    y      b
    pre-defined). Then XMIT the Out_DSN to your desired node. On the other node,
!                      t   b    y      b
    RECEIVE the Out_DSN. Then issue the command RECEIVE INDA(Out_DSN) to
!   t       b   y      b                        y                    b
    receive the VSAM flat file. Define your VSAM file and REPRO the flat file
!                                                         t    b
    into it.

  - The valid nodes to XMIT to (including node $XMIT) are displayed in the
!w b                   t   b                   g    b
    panel. Just place the cursor over the green colored node and it will be
    inserted into the field. (Designed to avoid typos.)

  - Use the above mentioned feature over $XMIT and it will prefix the low level
!w b                                     g    b
    qualifier with $ (truncated to 8 characters).
!                  yb
