 DB: DASD Blocking.
!t    !   t!

 This facility displays the DASD usage (3350, 3380 & 3390) for a specific LRECL
 entered and identifies the efficiencies againt each DASD type. If you have a
 mixture of DASD types, use the appropriate blocking to optimise efficiency in
 case datasets are move to unlike DASD types.

 You may change the LRECL by altering the appropriate field on the first screen
!                   y    !
 or in the appropriate table display field.

 You may limit your display to the more efficient blocking factors only
 by selecting Y against Efficient field in the first panel and masking the
!             y!        g        !
 DASD type with either *, $ or blank or by changing the first byte of
!                      y! y!   y    !
 the Eonly field followed by the appropriate 3 character mask for the
!    g    !                                  t!
 respecive types in the table display.

 Alternatively you may change the efficiency display from the command line by
 entering /Emmm where mmm are the respective *, $ or blank masks for the
!         y    !      y  !                   y! y ! y      !


 Depending on your DASD mix, avoid using blocking factors with Not Possible as
!                                                              r           !
 you will not be able to move it to that type of DASD without reorganisation.

 Masks:
   *  - has >=95% blocking efficiency (Super efficient).
!y    w !   g    !                     g     !
   $  - has between >85% and <95% (Standard efficient).
!y    w !           y   !    yg  ! y        !
!y
      - <85% efficiency (Not efficient).
!     w r   !           !r   !
 Choose the appropriate blocking in accordance with the I/O and buffer size
 requirements regarding applications usage. (Eg. For small 80 character members,
 blocking around 6K is most efficient when considering I/O.)

 Entries with * against all packs or a mix of * and $ is the ideal blocking mask
!             y!                              y!    y!
 factor for use on either type of DASD.

 If you do not have a particular type of DASD, leave it's relative position
 blank to avoid potentially missing efficient values for valid DASD.
 Example of use:-
=    y    w !
     Y*_* - Only entries where 3390 and 3350 are both super efficient (don't
            care about 3380s).
     Y**_ - Only entries where 3390 and 3380 are both super efficient (don't
            care about 3350s).
     Y_$_ - Only entries where 3380 is efficeint (not cecessarily super and
            don't care about 3390s or 3350s, maybe we don't have any).
     Y*$$ - All are efficient (3380 and 3350 need not be super efficient).
     N*$$ - Don't care about efficiency for any particular type (display ALL).

 Enter ALL or /A on the command line to display all entries.

 GOTCHAS:

 The output of DASD utilisation is held in an ISPF table (which is held in
 memory). As no I/O is involved, long execution of this job could cause the
 system to hang as this job would hog the CPU. (This excuse is fairly slim
 with modern CPUs and available MIPS.  Historically this routine was written
 primarily for migrating from 3350 to 3380.  3390 are a late add on.)

 To prevent this the maximum table entry creation has been limited to <1500.
!                                                                     wy   !
 This is achieved by the following algorithm:
     No._of_entries = ( End_block - Start_block ) / LRECL
!    g              w   y         w y           w   y
          Where the default values are:
=!                        wy
              Start_block -  6000
              End_block   - 23476

 You can tailor the number of entries by varying the Start and End parameters.
