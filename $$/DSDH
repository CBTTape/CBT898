 DS: DASD Space.
!y ! yt   yt

 This facility displays the free space on online DASD.

 On invocation you will be presented by an initial parameter entry screen.  To
 list all DASD, enter either * or ALL(SYSALLDA) as the parameter.
!                            y!   y  !
 You may limit the amount of display by entering one of the following:
=                                y
     Full volume serial      eg. PRM201   (or PRM201* to avoid esoteric search)
!                                y        !   y       !
     Part volume serial      eg. PRM2*
     Device address          eg. 0D80.    (note the use of . for wildcarding)
!                                y        !                y!
     Device string           eg. D8.
     Esoteric                eg. PERM, SYSDA
     Unit type               eg. 3390
     EDT list                    /EDT
     Everything                  BOX+DICE
=

 Wildcarding will primarily be performed on volume serial only. The trailing
 wildcard indicator * is optional, however if it is not present, an esoteric
!                   y!
 name search is assumed and will be performed first. If the esoteric search
 produces a negative result, an * will be appended and a volume search
!                               y!
 performed. A * suffix will always force a volume search.
!             y!
 For device addresses, append a . as the last character (even for full device
!                               y!
 names) as its presence differentiates between volume and device address.

 All other options must be fully entered. You cannot wildcard esoteric or unit
 names, (eg. 33* is a no-no).
!            r  !

 The /EDT option can be used to provide a list of the eligible device table
!    y    !
 which can then be used as esoteric/unit type parameters.

 The BOX+DICE parameter provides a full display all the units that are defined
!    y        !
 to the MVSCP (regardless of unit class). Note, some fileds for non-DASD devices
 may be incorrect as the routine is primarily a DASD reporting tool.

 You may vary the display size by passing parameter of F for full screen
!                                                      y !
 or W for window. (The display size will not affect the tutorial.)
!   y !

 The table display may be sorted as required. To sort the display enter /SORT on
!                                                                       y    !
 the command line followed by one of the codes bellow:
=y   w b
   UC - Unit control block (UCB).
   VO - Volume serial number. This is the default.
   FS - Free Space available.  You may pass a parameter of@A+or@D+for ascending
        and descending respectively.@D+is the default.
!
   NE - Number of Extents.
   LE - Largest Extent available.  You may pass a parameter of@A+or@D+for
        ascending and descending respectively.@D+is the default.
!
   MA - Mount attributes.
   AL - Alloction status.
   DS - Device status.
=
 The / in front of the sort is used to differentiate from a potential SORT*
!    y!                                                               y
 volume(s).

 Colourisation:
!g
 The following color codes are used for free space and extents (basically, green
!                                                                          g
 is good, yellow is acceptable  and red is bad);
!         y     !                   r   !
 Free space:
!5          !
  green   31-100 % Free of total capacity
!g        t      !
  yellow  11- 30 % Free of total capacity
!y        t      !
  red      0- 10 % Free of total capacity
!r        t      !
 Largest extent:
!5              !
  green   51-100 % Largest of free capacity
!g        t      !
  yellow  11- 50 % Largest of free capacity
!y        t      !
  red      0- 10 % Largest of free capacity
!r        t      !
 Number of extents:
!5                 !
  green      21+ Average number of free cylinders per extent
!g        t      !
  yellow  11-20  Average number of free cylinders per extent
!y        t      !
  red      0-10  Average number of free cylinders per extent
!r        t      !
 Note: The above colourisation of the number of extents gives an indication of
!w    !                               t                !
       free space fragmentation.  Basically red indicates that the amount of
!                                           r  !
       free space is distributed over a large(r) NUMBER of of extents.  In other
       words the free space is in smaller sized "chunks" than the green entries.
!                                                                 g    !

 The locate command /L may be used on the volume or UCB field depending on which
!                   y !
 field is subject to the current SORT operation. If the SORT is on volume, the
 first 6 characters of the parameter will be used as the locate criteria against
 the volser in the table. Otherwise, the first 3 against the UCB field.

 Column SM with an * indicates the pack is SMS managed.
!       t  !       y!

 The following are valid commands:

   /L ..  - Locate entry. See earlier screens.
   /PRINT - The table displayed will be presented as an edit of a temporary

 The following restricted commands commands are permitted for authorised users:
!
   /LD    - Caching status of all volumes.
   /ONLINE ucb

 The following selections are permitted against each line:
 P    - Print dataset stats. Same as "P" command against ISPF 3.4 on volume
!y    w!                              y!

 S    - Invoke ISPF option 3.4 on volume display.
!y    w!
 V    - Invoke the VTOC routine for that dataset. The info returned will be
!y    w!           t   !
        DSN, CAT, ALLOC, USED, UNUSED, PCT, DSO, RECFM, LRECL, BLKSZ. The data
        will be sorted in DSN order.
 X    - EXclude the entry from the table.
!y    w!
 The following selections are permitted against each line for authorised users:
=y   w b

 To rebuild the table with new parameters, enter the parameter on the the
 command line. The format is the same as on the initial parameter entry screen.

 You may refresh the current display by hitting [ENTER] without parameters on
!                                               w      !
 the command line.

 The following discribes customisation and use of the user exit.
!g
 To add user defined selection processing to the DS command, place a copy
!                                                y  !
 of DSUSERXT into your private library in either the SYSPROC or SYSEXEC dataset
!   y       !                                        w       !  w       !
 concatenations.

 You can add user defined commands and process in a similar manner as with
 selections. However, commands must be prefixed with a leading / to identify
!                                                              y!
 them as commands. Refer to the /EDT command.
!                               y    !

 A working copy of the user exit can be located using the TSO ISPFALOC command
!                                                         w            !
 followed by a F DSUSERXT under the SYSPROC concatenation.  (Refer to the
!              w          !         w       !
 ISPFALOC tutorial.)

 Modify your copy to cater for your individual selection processing.  It is the
 user's responsibility to provide for invalid selection error processing. A
 non-zero return code from this user exit will terminate any outstanding multi
 selections.

 To provide tutorials to cover user exit processing, make a copy of panel
 DASDSPHU into your private library in the ISPPLIB concatenation and modify it
!y       !                                 w       !
 accordingly, following tutorial panel chaining and selection processing.
