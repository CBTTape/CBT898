  This driver will invoke program ENQINFOL that will build an ISPF table or
!                                 y       b
  display using PUTLINE statements (that can be intercepted by a REXX OUTTRAP
!               t       b                                             w      b
  command), from the parameter(s) passed.

  Parameters (positional):
!g
    1. The requested ENQ resource parameter.
!   y  b
       If it is not wildcarded with a trailing *, one will be inserted for you
!                                              tb
       free of charge, unless a /ASIS keyword parameter is used.  By default,
!                               t    b
       your userid followed by an * will be inserted in the event you
!           t     b               tb
       transgress and omit a parameter (a /J will also be appended whether you
!                                         t  b
       like it or not).

       This parameter may be replace by one of the following keywords:
!                            w      b
=y               wb
         CONFLICT- which will display all the contentions on the system if they
                   exist.
         GRSC    - same as CONFLICT.
         RESERVE - which will naturaly display all the reserves.  During normal
                   use of this facility, overtype the Resource name with RESERVE
!                                                                        t
                   (no trailing *) to display reserves.
!                               tb

=
  The following keyword parameters are permitted:
!
=y           wb
    /ASIS    - take the resource ASIS and do NOT append an * if missing.
!y           wb                                            tb
    /J       - resource is a jobname or started task.
    /J(jname)- combine jname with the resource (if supplied).
!y           wb        w    b
    /Q(qname)- combine the qname with the resource (if supplied).
!y           wb            w    b
    /R       - resource is a Resource (default).
    /R(rname)- combine rname with the resource (if supplied).
!y           wb        w    b
    /S       - resource is a SYSID.
    /S(sysid)- combine sysid with the resource (if supplied).
!y           wb        w    b
    /TSO     - used to bypass ISPF table processing and display data through
               PUTLINE statements permitting capture using the OUTTRAP REXX
!              t      b                                        w       b
               command. This is the default in a Non-ISPF environment.  Note the
               actual data is after the headings and start on line 5.

=
  Once the screen is displayed, you may change any of the masks to home into
  your favourite ENQ combination.
!                w  b

  If there are long resource names enqueued, you can get a full display of the
  resource by using your RIGHT scroll PF key. The extra display will be at the
!                        w    b
  expense of the Scope  Status columns. You can restore the original diplay
!                7            b
  layout by using your LEFT scroll PF key.  If the resource is stiil too large
!                      w   b
  to fit onto the screen, use the /X (display resource in HEX) overlay to get
!                                 y b
  a full expansion of that resource in a message.

!y            wb

  The main program can be invoked directly. On entry, the parameter will default
  to your userid* and control stays within the program.  Alternatively it may
!         t      b
  be invoked by a dialog passing it additional parameters using ISPF VPUTs.

  This routine invokes the program passing it certain parameters and is
  re-entered by the program to perform the routine's own processing.  Control is
  directed by this EXEC.  You may enter the following overtypes in the resource
  display field to generate the indicated action:
=y       wb
     /B  - Browse dataset (minor, if valid DSNAME).
     /DL | /DS
!y       by
         - DataSet List (ISPF option 3.4)
     /E  - Edit dataset (converted to browse for valid VSAM datasets).
     /V  - View dataset (converted to browse for valid VSAM datasets).
     /W  - Who is user. Issues $BR LU jobname with jobname (if you have
!y       wb                    t             b
           RACF/ACF2 access).
           truncated to default jobname length.
     /J  - Display all resources for the Jobname.
     /X  - Display resource in HEX.
     /R  - Display all using this resource.
     /S  - Display all Systems using this resource.
     /34 - Dataset list (ISPF option 3.4)
     =   - Repeat last "action" against this resource.  (Must have
           issued a command previously.)
=
  You may sort the display by entering SORT or /S on the command
!                                      y   b   y b
  line followed by one of the following sub-parameters:
=y       wb
     J   - Jobname.
     R   - Resource.
     S   - Systemid.
=

  You may invoke the program and get it to pass the table back to your dialog.
  However, you must control table disposition thereafter not forgeting to CLOSE
  the table.

  The following are the parameters that may be set and VPUT to program ENQINFOL:
!                                                                      w       b
=y          wb
    KEEP    - Whether to return table to dialog.
               Y  indicates return table and exit program.
!              yb
               R  indicates to invoke routine XCMD from within the program and
!              yb                             y   b
                  keep control in the program. (This option is more efficient as
                  program initialisation is only done once.)
    XCMD    - Name of the routine to execute if KEEP=R. Default is ENQINFO.
!y          wb                                  t    yb            t      b
    TABLEMQ - Table name for Major Resource name build to display Qname
              selection screen.

!y          wb                       t w     b
              commands are stacked, where hhmmss is a system generated time (so
!                                         w     b
              don't issue the command twice in the same second).
    DISPNL  - Display panel name. You may tailor your own display screen.
              Default is ENQINFPY.

    IS2     o Status #2 wildcard parameter
    IQN     o Queue wildcard parameter (major)
    IRN     o Resource wildcard parameter (minor)
    IRT     o Reserve type
  Unless defaulting, all parameters marked with o should be initialised to *
!                                               wb                         t

 Additional features:
!g
  Rname
!y
     The resource name can be wildcarded with * as a string place holder and %
!                                             yb                             y
     as a character place holder anywhere inside the resource.  You still need a
     trailing * which will continue to be inserted free of charge.
!             yb

  GRSC
!y
     Enter GRSC on the command line or overtype the Rname field to display all
!          y   b                                    t    b
     the GRS contentions (if any). End PF key will return you to the previous
     display.
  RESERVE
!y
     Enter RESERVE on the command line or overtypr the Rname field to
!          y      b                                    t    b
     display all the reserves.

 The values under column R are as follows:
!                        tb
     C - Converted Reserve. RESERVE converted to an ENQ.
!y     w yb                 t      b                t  b
     N - Resource is an ENQ (ie. Not a Reserve)
!y     wb               t  b     yb
     R - RESERVE request.
!y     w yb

 If you place the cursor on the Qname literal on the sub-headline you will be
!                               7    b
 presented with a list of all the Major Queue names on the system.
!                                 w          b
 These major names are colour co-ordinated to differentiate in large displays.
 The current setting is in reverse video. To select a new major resource, either
 enter it's associated number on the command line or place the cursor on the
 name and hit [ENTER]. The new resource will be highlighted and placed in the
 wildcard line upon ending of the display.

 User exits can be coded in a member called ENQINFX. A sample exit should be
!                                           t      b
 included in this routine's package which will invoke Multi-Procs by default (if
 available).
 Any overtype in the Rname field, that is not covered in this tutorial, will be
!                    t    b
 passed to the user exit as the second parameter to the table name.
 The sample exit first issues a TBGET to get the appropriate original values. It
 then parses the overtype substituting the quoted original value for each of
 the /  encountered.
!    yb
 It then passes the function onto multi-procs (which may not be available to
 you).
