 1. LIMIT OF BROWSE.

 Currently restricted to VSAM KSDS, ESDS and RRDS datasets.  Records are
 presented in relative record order and KSDS datasets will not be sorted in key
 sequence.

 If key sequence is required for KSDS datasets, pass a parameter of@SORT+as
 per@MULTI PROCS+parameter passing. To enable sorting, a temporary ISPF table is
 built which is then accessed for sequential keys. This process can be quite
 timely for large VSAM datasets (may take minutes to build the table). If more
 than 1000 records are to be processed, a message will be issued every 1000
 records processed advising how many records of the total number have been
 processed. Once the table is built, processing is quite rapid.

 1. LIMIT OF BROWSE (cont'd).


 Because of the way ISPF processes records for browsing, it may take
 considerable time to process large@ESDS+datasets. You may pass a parameter of
 SORT+as with@KSDS+datasets if you are prepared to wait for the ISPF table
 creation. Unsorted is satisfactory for browsing records at the front of the
 dataset, however, for records near the end the entire dataset is read each time
 a previous record to the top of the screen is required.

 Extended edit commands are edit-macros written to facilitate character
 positioning and record number identification for split records that
 extending over multiple display lines.  Continuation lines and
 continuation characters are taken into consideration.  Be wary of their
 use as some may take a considerable time to execute.  (Eg.@XRECN #+will
 scan each line of the display and accumulate all lines without a
 continuation character in column 1. This can be quite timely for large
 datasets.)

 The following extended edits commands are available:
 XCOLS +- Means of indicating the columns because of the split record feature.
          This command is disabled if the LRECL < 256 characters. Either place
          the cursor on the line to be marked or pass it the line number as a
          parameter after the@XCOLS+command.  Note the difference between line
          number and record number.  A@MSG+entry will be made for that line on
          the long message line and the line will be scrolled to the top.
          However, this will disappear on the next entry.

          You may pass a second parameter of@NOTE+which will display a@NOTE+line
          (similar to COLS command) in blue, immediately above the desired line.

          You may set the@XCOLS+display option in the default setup panel.

  XCHAR +- Use this command to place the cursor on the desired character
           position for the current record. The current record is considered the
           first record at the top of screen or the record where the cursor is
           positioned if it is not on the command line. If the position
           requested is greater than the record length (for variable datasets),
           an appropriate message will be displayed.

           You may pass the line number as the first parameter if you chose not
           to place the cursor on the appropriate line, however the char
           position must then be the second parameter.

  XDEFS +- Invokes the Extended Edit default panel. This will permit changing of
           default parameters, in particular the@continuation indicator+, during
           the edit session. If the continuation indicator is changed, remember
           to change it in the edited lines or the data will not be rebuilt
           correctly.
           NOTE+- Certain parameters will not be in affect until the next
                  extended edit session, eg.  screen width.


  XDOWN +- Use this command to scroll the data being edited by number of logical
           records rather than lines (for split records).  Pass the number of
           records to scroll down as a parameter.  If scrolling is past end of
           data, the@BOTTOM OF DATA+banner is dispalyed.
           This option will display an error message if record length < 256
           characters.

           empty-slot or an@ESDS+VSAM dataset record as deletable. For further
           details on ESDS datasets, refer to tutorial option@4.3+. This command
           will insert the literal@(EMPTY-SLOT)+every 80 bytes along the line
           representing the particular physical record. If the record is split,
           all continuation lines will be deleted and only the empty-slot
           indicator will be displayed. If by any chance the literal
           (EMPTY-SLOT)+is a valid data value in column 1 for 12 bytes, enter a
           different empty-slot literal in the default entries@DEFS+. This
           command requires a numeric physical record parameter.

  XRECN +- Use this command to bring a particular record to the top of the
           display. Because of continuation lines, the sequence numbers do not
           reflect the correct record number.  All continuation lines will be
           excluded, unless specified in the default setup screen, and the
           required record number will be scrolled to the top line of the
           display screen.
           The following parameters can be used:
            n     +- Where@n+is the record number to bring to top of screen. If
                     the parameter is > number of records, an appropriate
                     message is displayed. You may pass a second parameter
                     of@R+to override the default reset parameter.
            ?     +- Display which record is at the top of display.
            #     +- Display the number of records in the dataset.

  XSORT +- Use this command to attempt to sort split records.  Split records
           cannot be sorted because of continuation lines created when the
           logical record length is greated than the permissable 255 characters
           supported by the ISPF editor.  However certain variable length
           datasets (NONVSAM and VSAM) may not physically have records > 255
           characters. This command will search column 1 for the continuation
           indicator and if it is not found, ie. no continuation lines, it will
           attempt to sort the records.

           You may pass up to 22 sort parameters. Refer to the ISPF editor
           tutorial for sort parameters.

 1. SETTING UP OF DEFAULT VARIABLE.

 During the edit session you can change the defaults by entering@XDEF¢(Extended
 edit defaults) on the command line.

 When selecting edit under@MULTI PROCS¢, the default parameters are
 automatically displayed unless the bypass default display is set to@Y¢.
 If the bypass flag is set, you can turn it off by invoking extended edit
 with a non-blank parameter or entering@XDEF¢on the command line during
 any extended edit session and changing it.  Invoking@XDEF¢outside an
 Extended-edit session may store the variables in a wrong PROFILE.

 The current @continuation indicator¢will be permanently displayed if you are
 editing a dataset over 255 characters.

 Be wary of changing defaults during an edit session. If you change the
 continuation character, ensure you do a global change in column 1 to keep it
 consistant with existing records otherwise they will be treated as new records.

 b) Continuation character:
     This is a character to indicate the continuation lines for split records.
     Split records are records@> 255¢characters broken up into display width
     lengths. The default is set to@+¢.  It is suggested you BROWSE the dataset
     first and issue a@FIND c 1 1 ALL¢(where@c¢is the cont'n char). If any
     records are found then change the indicator and repeat the refind. (Define
     the new indicator under@XDEFS¢.)  If you cannot use any printable character
     as a contionuation indicator, you may define a HEX continuation character.
     Simply enter the Hex value into the@HEX¢field and enter@X¢into the
     continuation indicator field. If the continuation indicator is in Hex, the
     message line will notify continuation indicator as@X'CC'¢.

 h) RRDS empty-slot indicator:
     The default@RRDS+empty-slot indicator is@(EMPTY-SLOT)+. However, if this
     could be part of a valid record starting in column 1, you will need to pass
     a unique 12 character string to indicate empty-slots. Use a similar
     technique to the continuation indicator to ascertain unique empty-slot
     indicator. Under BROWSE, HEX zeros will be padded between the empty-slot
     literals per record line.
     This indicator will also be used by the extended-edit routines to indicate
     deleted records out of@ESDS+datasets if over write option is used. Can also
     be used to mark a record as deleted and either tested by application or use
     edit global change commands to convert to appropriate deleted record
     indicator.

 1. SETTING UP OF DEFAULT VARIABLES (cont'd):

 i) ESDS update type:
     This flag indicates how@ESDS+datasets are to be updated.
     A+indicates that records displayed in the edit session are to be appended
     to the dataset.  Consequently original records that are not to change
     should be deleted.

     N+indicates that en empty display screen is to be presented and the data
     entered will be appended to the dataset.  Similar to@A+except unwanted
     records need not be deleted.

     O+indicates that records are to be over written. If records are deleted
     during the edit session, the empty-slot indicator will be inserted over the
     original record. Be aware that records deleted not from the end will alter
     the sequence of the ESDS dataset with empty slots at the end. Rather than
     delete records in the dataset use the@XESLOT+command to mark the record as
     pseudo-deleted and test for the empty-slot indicator in application
     programs.

 2. RECORD LENGTH CONSIDERATIONS:

 VSAM dataset with record length@< 10+characters will be expanded to 10
 characters and then truncated to the logical record length during rewrite. This
 could cause problems with variable length VSAM datasets < 10 characters.

 Datasets@> 255+characters will be split over multiple lines in accordance
 with the display screen size defined or defaulted. Multiple lines will be
 distinguished by the defined@continuation character+in column 1. When the
 records are re-written, lines with continuation characters in column 1 will be
 appended to the previous line. All lines without a continuation character in
 column 1 will be treated as a new record.

 3. ATTENTION/PROBLEM AREAS.

 VSAM datasets or datasets > 255 characters are read and data is passed to ISPF
 for processing under it's editor. To enable changes to be cancellable, ISPF
 keeps a record of all changes. When the dataset is saved/ended all existing
 records are deleted, and the dataset is rebuilt from records maintaned by ISPF.
 Because of this, ending an edit session of a large dataset could take
 considerable time.  Plan carefully and try to make all changes in the one edit
 session.

 Be wary of the@repeat+line command. This potentially creates duplicate keys for
 VSAM datasets.  Duplicated keys will retain the first record processed.

 The@copy+and@move+line commands will potentially unsort VSAM dataset from
 ascending key sequence. VSAM records must be in ascending key order. Prior to
 ending edit session, ensure you issue a@SORT+on the key indicated by line 3.
 All records lower than the last key processed will be lost.

 3. ATTENTION/PROBLEM AREAS (cont'd).

 DO NOT SORT SPLIT RECORDS.+Sorting of split records will bring the
 continuation lines to the front and totally corrupt the re-writen dataset.
 Manually rearrange records`WITH BLOCK MOVES+.

 Be very careful using shift left or right line commands, especially with split
 records as shift will not flow onto the continuation lines and corrupt the key
 field for VSAM datasets.  Similarly be careful with@text flow/split+commands
 for the same reason.

 It is the users responsibility to maintain integrity of split records by paying
 careful attention to continuation characters in column 1.  (Ensure that the
 continuation character you are using, is not a valid character in the first
 column of each record.)

 3. ATTENTION/PROBLEM AREAS (cont'd).

 Because of the split record feature, the failure of a@FIND+command may be due
 to a record being split over several lines and the string flowing over to the
 next line. Consequently you may need to truncate the find string and issue
 several finds to be certain the string does not exist.

 4. PROCESSING ACCORDING TO VSAM TYPE.

    The following topics are presented in sequence or may be selected by code:
    1+- KSDS datasets
    2+- RRDS datasets
    3+- ESDS datasets

 4.1 KSDS TYPE DATASETS:

 Duplicate entries will be ignored.
 Any key encountered that is less than the previous sucessful entered key will
 be ignore and all subsequent keys until the next higher key is encountered.
 Consequently a@KSDS+dataset sorted in descending order would insert the last
 record (the first logical record in the edit session) and reject the rest.

 It is therefore recommended that if data is to be moved you issue the@XCHECK
 command to ensure that the keys are in sequence. (This command may be timely
 for large@KSDS+datasets.)

 4.2 RRDS TYPE DATASETS:

 For RRDS datasets, empty slots will be displayed with the literal@(EMPTY-SLOT)
 every 80 bytes. Records should not be deleted but rather use the@XESLOT+command
 against the record number (remember sequence numbers for split records do not
 reflect record number).  If you insert a record, it may throw the whole RRDS
 out unless an appropriate record is deleted.

 Empty slots will not generate split records and will always occupy 1 line
 regardless of record length and format.

 4.2 ESDS TYPE DATASETS:

 You may update@ESDS+datasets by one of three methods which is specified on the
 extended edit defaults entry screen. These options are:

   A+Append data to the end of the dataset.  All the data is read in into the
     edit session and it is the users responsibility to only leave the records +
     that are to be appended to the dataset and unwanted records to be deleted
     to prevent duplicated data at the end of the dataset.

   N+New entries only. An empty screen is presented and it is the users
     responsibility to enter the data that will be appended to the@ESDS+dataset.
     It is the users responsibility to establish record lengths and continuation
     lines for fixed length records (as short data will have garbage at the end.
     NOTE+- If you enter extended edit with this option and change this value to
            O+existing records will be lost.

 4.2 ESDS TYPE DATASETS (cont'd):

   O+Over write the dataset. The records will be process from the start of the
     screen and over laid sequentially from the start of the dataset. If a
     record has been deleted from a variable length dataset and the logical
     record length of the next record that will over write the deleted record is
     longer, then that record will be truncated to the deleted record. Extra
     records will be appended to the end of the dataset.  Missing (deleted)
     records will be replaced by a record identical to the empty-slot indicator
     defined in the defaults entry screen.

 If a record is to be deleted, it is suggested to use the@XESLOT+command to mark
 the record as an empty slot and either test for that in the application program
 or use an appropriate@CHANGE ALL+edit command to convert it to the appropriate
 deleted record indicator.
