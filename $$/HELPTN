!G

 On entry you will be presented with an index (if it exists).  Use the
 highlighted codes to fast track to the relevant topic.
 [ENTER] will bring up the firt topic in the Index. Therafter [ENTER] by itself
!y       !                                                    y       !
 will do nothing.
 Note - [ENTER] by itself will display an appropriate message if there are no
!w      y      !
        open_paragraphs (OP). (Refer below for further details.)
!       2              ! y !

 Entering I on the command line will return you to the Index.
!         y!

 Use the UP/DOWN PF keys to scroll up/down through the tutorial. You can qualify
!        y !y    !
 the scroll amount bu either entering the amount on the command line or in the
 cursor field.
 You cannot scroll off the Index or "non fast tracked" topics.

 You may use the LEFT/RIGHT PF keys to navigate through closed_paragraphs.
!                y   !y    !                            2                !
 (Refer below for further details.) Only available once inside a closed
 paragraph.

 Use the END PF key or X to terminate the tutorial.
!        y  !          y!

?HYPER_LINKS
 You may use hyper_links to fast track to keyword topics (assuming tutorial
!            2          !
 designer used the feature) by placing the cursor on this colored underlined
 text.  If it is not a hyper_link an appropriate error message will be
 displayed. Hyper_links should be in the keywords list (refer /KEYW below).
!                                                             y    !
 It is recommended to issue a /M R command before using a hyper_link if you wish
!                             y   !
 to return to that spot.  You can then return by entering /M by itself to the
!                                                         y !
 same display as before invoking the hyper_link.
 Keep track of the Tutorial Headline.  If this changes after using a hyper_link
!                  g                !
 the END PF key should return you to the original display, otherwise use the /M
!                                                                            y
 command.

 Commands:
!g
   /F {cc} - Find string cc, where cc is any character string. If string
!y    !y ! w!            y !       y !
             contains imbedded spaces it should be quoted (but not mandatory).
             Note - The find command is NOT case sensitive.
!w                  !
                  - All scans are in a forward direction. There is no facility
!w                  !
                    to provide parameters as all operands are included in the
                    search string. (Next release????)
                  - Once a cc string has been supplied, a /F by itself is the
!w                  !      y  !                           y  !
                    same as /FN or /RF.
!                           y   !  y  !
   /F=F    - Permits the use of F (without the "/") for the find command.
!y         w!                   y !             y!
             This will also affect the /FN and /RF commands.  However, note that
!                                      y   !   y  !
             tutorial keyword F, FN and RF can not be used for that session
!                             y! y  !   y  !
             after the /F=F command.
!                      y    !
   /FN     - Find next occurance of string from previous find command.  The scan
!y         w!
             will continue from the provious hit and may reoccur on the same
             line.
             Note - The find next command does not reposition to top of tutorial
!w                  !
                    when the bottom is reached. You will have to scroll MAX UP
                    and reisue the /FN command.
!                                  y   !
   /H      - Display hyper_links in table format. (Handy when combined with line
!y         w!
             mode which is covered below.)
   /In1 {Off}
!y
?closed_paragraphs
?open_paragraphs
           - At times the tutorial developer may design the tutorial to be
!          w!
             displayed as dedicated topics (referred to as closed paragraphs
             CP) with scrolling restricted within the topic. With this command,
!            y !
             you can make the whole tutorial displayable in one scrollable
             display (open paragraph OP). Fast track is still available.
!                                    y !
           - Pass parameter of OFF to turn the in one feature off.
!          w!                  y  !            y      !
           - You may use the LEFT and RIGHT PF keys to navigate through these
!          w!                y   !    y    !
             CPs by jumping to previous or next topics respectively. You can
!            y !
             then scroll up and down depending on the CPs size.
!                                                     y !
   /Keyw   - Displays a list of all the keywords generated that can be used to
!y         w!
             fast track to Indexed part of the tutorial.
   /Line nn- Place display in line mode (line number at top right corner).
!y         w!
             On entry to a tutorial, the headline has the literal "Tutorial" at
!                                                                  g       !
             each end. At times you may wish to fast move to specific lines or
             return after using hyper_links without relying on the /Mark feature
!                                                                  y    !
             (you can only mark 1 line).  This can be achieved by passing a
             parameter of nn, where nn is the line number. A check is made for
!                         y !       y !
             the number in the range of the scope of the tutorial. An
             appropriate message will be displayed.
             The first number is the line number at the top of the screen and
             the second is the last line of the tutorial display.  The entry of
             /L without parameters will just turn line mode on while with a
!            y !
             valid number line mode will be turned on and the line will be moved
             to the top of the screen.
             Notes - Line mode cannot be turned off once invoked.
!w                   !
                   - Line mode may give unpredictable when using CP or when
!w                   !                                           y !
                     within indexes.
   /LC     - List closed paragraph ids. All CP identifiers will be reported in
!y         w!                               y !
             the ISPF message.
   /LV     - List Variables passed by the main application for substitution into
!y         w!
             the tutorial.  This command is used for testing purposes.
   /Mark xx- Mark position in tutorial for fast track on next invocation during
!y         w!
             the same application session.
             (Large tutorials can be so designed that the first time they are
             invoked from an application the details are built and kept until
             the termination of the application. This design feature eliminates
             the need to rebuild the tutorial each time it is invoked.
             Note - This feature is controled by the application's tutorial
!w                  !
                    designer.)

             Paramaters xx can be:
!                       y  !
               R   - Resets the mark to top of the current screen.
!y                 w!
               Off - Turns marking off.
!y                 w!
                   - (blank). Sets the mark if not previously set or repositions
!              Yw   !
                     to the mark if set.
              Note - If a mark is set, you will automatically be positoned at it
!w                   !
                     on the next invocation unless the application explicitly
                     directs you to a different place.
                   - Use the /M O option to return to normal tutorial placement.
!w                   !       y   !
   /Print {ALL}
!y
           - Presents the tutorial without all the colourisation in an edit
!y         w!
             session that can then be printed offloaded at user's discretion.
             If the tutorial is a closed paragraph only that topic will be
             printed. Use parameter of ALL to print the entire tutorial.
!                                      y  !

             Note - Variables will not be substituted in the print output as
!w                  !
                    substitution is done just prior to display, however, REXX
                    commands will have been executed to build table in
                    preperation for displaying.
