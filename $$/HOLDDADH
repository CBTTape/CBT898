 HOLDDATA permit browsing of SMP/E hold data.  You may exclude certain data to
!5       !
 minimise processing (eg. ignore DOC).

 As a bonus, any PTFs that cannot be APPLYed because of missing requisites will
 be tagged accordingly.

           the appropriate value in the reason field (not comma).

 Miscellaneous:
!g
 The CAUSER display is not necessarily complete. If there are more causers than
!    y     !
 can fill the display area (continuation lines in SMP/E output) there should be
 enough problems with the PTF/APAR to warrant direct referal to the held output
 rather than this summary.

 There are two screen displays.  You can toggle between the CAUSER (initial) and
!                                                           y     !
 the FMID displays respectively by entering a DT (for Display Toggle) on the
!    y   !                                    y !     y!      y!
 command line.
 These screens can be identified by the (x) in the top left corned after the
!                                       y  !
 HoldData heading.
!y       !
 The FMID display allows for a greater number of hold reason displays.

 When invoking HOLDDATA pass a parameter of /B to browse all PTFs one after the
!              t        !                   y !
 other. Using the END PF key will bring up the next member.  To break this loop
!                 w   !
 ensure you have access to the QUIT command and enter TSO QUIT * on the command
!                              y   !                  y         !
 line.
