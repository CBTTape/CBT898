+Selections:
@H       +- Extract and browse HOLD data only.  Can supplement with hold reason
+           on the command line as per the@O+command or place the cursor over
+           the appropriate value in the reason field (not comma).
@P       +- Print HOLDdata for PTF. Can supplement with hold reason on the
+           command line as per the@O+command or place the cursor over the
+           appropriate value in the reason field (not comma).
@S       +- Select/Browse PTF.
@V       +- View PTF.
@X       +- Exclude (delete) from display. Must exit and re-execute@HOLDDATA+to
+           to bring back entries.
+
+Miscellaneous:
+The@CAUSER+display is not necessarily complete. If there are more causers than
+can fill the display area (continuation lines in SMP/E output) there should be
+enough problems with the PTF/APAR to warrant direct referal to the held output
+rather than this summary.
