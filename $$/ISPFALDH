 This facility list all the allocations to the current TSO session.  Returned
 from navigating the Task Input/Output Table (TIOT) using program DSNALLOC.

 The allocations are initially listed in a table, displaying the first dataset
 in the concatenation against each DDNAME. It also displays the number of
 datasets in the concatenation.

 Two displays are produced:
  1. Summary of all DDs allocated, (refered to as the primary screen).
!g w!                                                 t      !
  2. Detailed listing of all datasets against a particular DDname, (referred to
!g w!
     as the secondary screen).

 You may enter any MULTI PROCs(MP) option against each line.  Note, some of the
!                  y         ! y !
 options will not be permitted, eg. deleting a dataset that is allocated.  For
 further details, enter HMP on the command line to display an index of available
!                       y  !
 options. In the index, enter the option to get further details.

 To make these options available, invoke this routine with a parameter of MP.

 The following discribes customisation and use of the user exit.

 To add user defined selection processing to the ISPFALOC command, place a copy
!                                                y        !
 of ISPFALUX into your private library in either the SYSPROC or SYSEXEC dataset
!   y        !                                       y       !  y       !
 concatenations.

 Modify your copy to cater for your individual selection processing.  It is the
 user's responsibility to provide for invalid selection error processing. The
 model should provide enough customisation examples.

 To provide tutorials to cover user exit processing, make a copy of panel
 ISPFALHU into your private library in the ISPPLIB concatenation and modify it
!y        !                                y       !
 accordingly following tutorial panel chaining and selection processing.

     The following parameters (variables) may be passed by the invoking dialog
     through the ISPF shared variable pool. The brackets contain max length:

       DD       (08) - DDNAME. If only the concatenations for a particular

                       created, and passed back to the dialog without displaying
                       it. It is up to the dialog to display and close the
                       table. If this parameter is set and the table parameter
                       is missing, this parameter will be turned off as the
                       dialog will not know the internally generated table name.
                       If this parameter is off, the table will be displayed by
                       this program using the default panelid
     Output:

       zedlmsg  (79) - Error message, if RC from program is ¬0.
