 LMD.
 ~~~~
 LMD (Last Modified Date) is a REXX front end onto program ALKLMDAT.

 1. Upload dataset onto the mainframe into a predefined DSORG=PS,
    LRECL=80, RECFM=FB dataset in binary format.
 2. Issue a RECEIVE INDA(above.dsn) to receive members into a PDS.  You
    can control the output name by issuing command DA('your.pds.name').
    Default is 'userid.$$.LMD'.
 3. For a quick copy of the load module use the RECEIVE command against
    member 'ALKLMDL' which will extract load module into a load library
    which you can execute immediately in batch by using the JCL sample
    provided in the assembler source (member ALKLMDAT).
    Default is 'userid.$LOAD'.

 JCL to run the program (assuming default loadlib):-
   //userid  JOB .....
   //*
   //* Parameter format: PARM='ddmmyy,program*'
   //*    Where program mask is optional (trailing '*' also op[tional)
   //*    and date is European format. Y2K is < 010170 (1970).
   //*
   //STEP010  EXEC PGM=ALKLMDAT,PARM='311204'
   //STEPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=userid.$LOAD
   //LMODLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=the.loadlib.to.be.scanned
   //LMODLIST DD  SYSOUT=*


 The remaining members are only required to execute on-line.

 To enable online usage:
   1. Copy members $DATEMAN and LMD into a valid SYSPROC/SYSEXEC
      concatenated dataset or add a valid altlib statement at the start
      of member 'LMD'.
      Other members are just support routines to make life easy(er).
   2. Copy load module ALKLMDAT into an ISPLLIB concatenated dataset.

                         - or -

   3. If you use the default names, under native TSO (READY prompt)
      issue EX 'userid.$$.LMD(LMDALLOC)'

 Additional fine tuning:
   1. In either case ensure member $ALKLOAD will return the correct
      loadlib name the load module was received into. This should be OK
      if defaults were used.
   2. Change variable "cname1st" in member 'LMD' as required to identify
      urer by christian name.
   3. Refer to member "LMD" for further details in fine tuning.
