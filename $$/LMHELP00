*-----------------------< LMHELP00 for LINEMAC >-----------------------*
  The following line commands have been expanded as a 1 line description
  is considered insufficient.

  Cmd    Description
  ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
         Member processing line commands:
         --------------------------------
         LMPRMEMB:
         ~~~~~~~~~
         All the following commands use routine "LMPRMEMB". It has been
         basically designed to process members using the index of the
         PDS created by the "INDEX" command (if available and it should
         be if LINEMAC is available).
         Some commands will accept parameters by overtyping the line (as
         command line data cannot be processed), however, this will
         cream your data.  To automatically restore your data, enter
         "/R" as the last word on the line.  The simplest way to achieve
         this is to type in your parameter(s) followed by a space
         seperated /R and the do an EOL (erase End_Of_Line).

         Notes:
          1. Data in columns 73-80 are ignored.
          2. It is recommended that you use the "INDEX" command to keep
             your index member list up to date.  If LINEMAC is
             available, it's highly probable that "INDEX" will also be.
             Enter "INDEX ?"  in any edit/view session to see if it
             available. The "?"  parameter will display the tutorial as
             notelines and the "INDEX" command cannot accidentaly
             change/corrupt your member UNLESS the member name contains
             "INDEX" in it.
          3. Ensure you scroll to the top before crying WOLF.

  BM     Browse Member from line.
  BMC    Browse Member at Cursor (requires cursor placement).
  CM     Copy member 'a' to 'b' using MAC(LMPRMEMB). You will be
         prompted for the new name (and dataset/volume if required).
         Member may be copied to another dataset (catalogued/un).
         If member exists (in destination dataset), you will be prompted
         to enter "REPLACE" on the command line.
  CMU    Copy member 'a' to 'b' + Update "index" with new line.
  CP     Copy member (1st. word) from same PDS after cursor into
         session.  This command exploits this feature by permitting you
         to insert the source member, followed by '/R' and EOF.  If you
         do not like this, put your cursor on the command line, enter
         "COPY member_name" scroll down and place a "A" on the line you
         want it copied after and hit enter.
  DM     Delete member from line.
  DMU    Delete member from line + Delete line from "index".
  EM     Edit Member from line.
  EMC    Edit Member at Cursor (requires cursor placement).
  KM     Compare Member from line using SuperC. "With" dataset(member) can
         be overtyped over 2nd. member (initialised to 1st. member in
         SuperC screen.)
         This facility requires access to customise IBM panels. See your
         dialog developer if it does not work and you want it.
         (Why "K" for Compare, because "C" has been taken, donkey.)
  MS     Member Stats from line (same as 'ST').
         Used to be the same as 'SM' but I confuse them hence I had both
         and since I have used "SM" for Select Member and found it
         easier to crap on here than remove "MS" option.
  RM     Rename Member from line.
  RMU    Rename Member from line + Update line in "index".
  SM     Select Member for perusal (default is 'VM' - View member).
         You can set your default using the 'SMB', 'SME' or 'SMV' line
         commands.  Note, the defaults will need to be set for each
         different ISPF "applid".
         Alternatively use the explicit 'BM', 'EM' or 'VM' commands.
  SMB    Select Member for Browse and will set the "SM" default to
         'Browse'.
  SME    Select Member for Edit and will set the "SM" default to 'Edit'.
  SMV    Select Member for View and will set the "SM" default to 'Vdit'.
  ST     STats for member from line in NOTELINE (same as MS).
  SUBM   SUBmit Member from line.
  VM     View Member from line.
  VMC    View Member at Cursor (requires cursor placement).
  XM     eXecute Member from line.

                             ******

  BD     Browse Dataset from line.
  DL     DSLIST (ISPF opt 3.4 for dataset).
  ED     Edit DSN from line.
  VD     View DSN from line.
         The above four command should be used if you are unfortunate
         enough not to have "XE" available, however, you will need
         access to command "XB".

                             ******

  CL     Comment line with '/*...*/' in cols 1 & 71.  This is a toggle.
         Note: If columns 1 and 2 are not blanks, the line will be
               shifted right accordingly.  When toggled back, any prior
               shifting cannot be reversed as there is no record kept of
               the shift and you cannot determine whether the blanks
               were previously there or not.
  CLC    Comment line with '/*...*/,' cols 1 & 70. Works similar to the
         "CL" line command except that a comma is appended to indicate
         the line is continued.  This is made available for cases where
         commenting a line may interfere with logic or syntax.  Again,
         any shifting cannot be reversed.
  CLD    Comment line with '/*...*/,' cols 45 & 71. This command is
         designed for on line doco (usually variable setting doco). The
         cursor will automatically be placed within the comment
         delimiters.  This command is not togglable.

                             ******

         Help features:
         --------------
  HELP   This consists of a one-line list of all the commands extracted
         dynamically from LINEMAC and all the associated chained exits.
         As the list is dynamically built it will always be up to date,
         however, it short description is only as reputable as it's last
         dodgy modifier.
         Note:
          1. Some commands may appear in multiple exits. These may be
             duplicates or may actually have different functionality
             from another author.  Nevertheless, while the list may be
             sorted within the exit(s), the exits are displayed in a
             hierarchical order of execution and the command listed
             first will be the one executed.
  HELPX  This command will expand on the single line description offered
         by the 'HELP' command (at the discretion of the author).  It
         will be as up to date as dictated by the conscience of the
         exit's author (hence seek out the author based on the last 2
         characters of the exit name).
  HELP+  This command will display HELP for building line commands, it's
         infrastructure and goes into fair depth to identify and define
         the functionality of the LineMac Manager (LMM).

                             ******

  LEV    Generate macro Level checking code. Use in ")M" destined mac
         Use this command on existing macros called by LINEMAC or an
         exit.

                             ******

  LMV    LINEMAC (infrastructure component) versions.  Use this command
         to find the version identifiers for the 3 LINEMAC infra-
         structure components LM1, LM2 and LM3. Very useful for
         identifying back leveled versions.

                             ******

  VB     VSAM Browse - using CMD(%VB).
         This feature may be made available for sites without File-Aid.
         Note: Requires access to command "VB" and its infra structure.
