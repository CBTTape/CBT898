  Cmd    Description
  ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------
  %HELP  -or- HELP%
         Multi-procs help tutorial.  This line command will invoke the
         dynamic tutorial for "XE" which will list all the Multi-Procs
         commands.  You will need access to Multi-Procs tutorial (not
         commonly distributed) for further details on individual
         commands.  Refer to your dialog developer for availability of
         detailed tutorial.

         Multi-Procs (MP) line commands:
         -------------------------------
  %*     Prefix any MP command with a '%' to pass the extracted dataset
         (or DSLIST mask) to MP (CSMDSN) for processing if it is
         available.  If it is not available you will get a line command
         error.
         As an alternative you may have the MP command following the
         dataset prefixed by a '/' (which is a valid MP interface prefix
         exploited by the "XE" routine). By this method you only need to
         enter '%' by itself to execute the MP command against the
         evaluated dataset. "XB" is used as the processor to extract the
         dataset name from the line.  For further details on how "XB"
         works enter 'TSO %BR XB ?' on the command line for further
         details.

         To exploit the extensive flexibility of Multi-Procs, enter
             LMP p1 {,p2....pn}
         on the command line before the actual linemac command to pass
         paremeter(s) p% to Multi-Procs.

         Notes:
             - If used in a view/edit session where variables are set
               after the line (eg. instream procs) tell MP to scan from
               the last card by using the following "LMP" command to
               supplement the MP line command,
                   LMP /L
             - The default action is '%V' which is view (or '/V' passed
               to MP) unless the dataset "name" containg a masking
               patterm containing "%" or "*" whereby the action will be
               '%DL' (dataset list - ISPF 3.4).
         Examples:
         1.  A % line command will result in the following dataset being
             edited:
               SYS1.PROCLIB.CPU1,VOL=SER=DASD01      /E
         2.  A % line command will result in the string being passed to
             DSLIST (ISPF 3.4):
               SYS*.PROCLIB                          /DL
