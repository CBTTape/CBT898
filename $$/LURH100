+This facility permits you to display all userids that match a combination of
+christian and surname entered (and optionally userid).  You may suffix all
+three parameters with an@*+to wildcard and compare with starting values.
+A@space+or@*+will inlude all.
+
+You can also prefix both christian and surname with a leading@*+to match
+anywhere in the name (don't forget the trailing@*+).
+
+The@circa+date on the headline indicates the age of the RACF database extract.
+If it is too old re-extract.  Following is a sample JCL to offload the RACF
+database. It includes a step to extract the type@0200+records from the
+offloaded dataset.  The second step may be omitted if your RACF database is not
+too large and may be used instead.  However, the dataset name must adhere to
+naming standards expected by the@LUR+dialog.
