&  MM: Member Manager [V&MMV.], Tutorial MMDH: [V1.12].
!  y  t

   This routine will permit member comparisons between two partitioned
   datasets based primarily on date last changed.  It can also be used to
   compare member lists when stats are turned off.
   You can even compare load libraries (RECFM=U) however only partial stats
   will be returned.  Exploit this functionality to compare load modules
   compile/link-edit date with last modified date of source (and draw
   whatever conclusion takes your fancy).

   It can be used to rationalise the two datasets and simply update members
   from one to the other whether it is a progressive (latest) or regresive
   (backout) update.  This can be done at the member level or if you are
   adventurous, at the dataset level.

   You can optionally create a hybrid of the two datasets without altering
   the contents of either one.

   Parameters:
!g
     Positional:
       1. 'dsn1' - The first dataset in the comparison. This dataset must be
!t        yg   y w!
                   fully qualified and quoted, otherwise it will be prefixed by
&                    '&#SPRF..'
!y
       2. 'dsn2' - The second dataset in the comparison. Same format as the
!t        yg   y w!
                   first however if it is missing, it will default to
                     'dsn1.BACKUP'
!y                    g   w      y
       3. En     - Exist indicator. Same value as for the "Refresh table"
!t        yt     w!                                        y!
                   command's parameter.
     Notes: - You may append a volser to uncatalogued datasets seperated by
!w            !
              an "=" sign. (The dataset before the = still requires applicable
!                 y!                               y!
              quotes.)
            - Uncatalogued volumes will be included in the "Changed" heading
!           w!
              and may be altered using the "VOLn=volser" command.
!                                           y  tyg     !
     Keyword:
       /OB  - Only Both. Same processing logic as if ONLY BOTH is entered on the
!y          w y!   y!                                t         t
              member compare screen.  This parameter is automatically generated
              by LINEMAC when using the MMO line command (if LINAMEAC is
!                t       !              y   !                t        !
              available).
       /V   - Determine/generate volume (if not supplied) and use it as if
!y          w!
              it was supplied as part of the dataset parameter.

   Invocation:
   1. Under TSO:
!y    !
=t
       TSO %MM
       TSO %MM 'dsn1'
!t              g   t
       TSO %MM dsn1 'dsn2'=volser E2
!t             g    tg   t g      t
       TSO %MM ?

   2. Under ISPF option 3.4 against dataset:
!y    !
       MM
       MM / 'dsn2'
!t           g   t
       MM / /=volser E1
!t            g      t
=

   3. Edit macro:
!y    !
       MM on the command line and a 'C' on the first line containing
!      y  !                          y!
       dsn1 and dsn2 on two adjacent lines. dsn1 and dsn2 must be fully
!      g    !   g    !                      g    !   g    !
       qualified and may or may not be quoted. Volume will be extracted
       from any "VOL=SER=volume" value found on the line.
!                y       g     !

   4. Line command:
!y    !
       The appropriate line command (use the HELP/HELPR line command to
!                                            w   !w     !
       establish it) on the first line of two adjacent lines containg
       both datasets.  dsn1 and dsn2 must be fully qualified and may or
!                      g    !   g    !
       may not be quoted.  Volume will be extracted from any
       "VOL=SER=volume" value found on the line.
!       y       g     !

   5. REXX
!y    !
=t
&      d1="'&#SPRF..ORIGINAL'"
&      d2="'&#SPRF..ORIGINAL.TO.NOTSO.ORIGINAL.BACKUP'"=volser
       x=MM(d1 d2)
       x=MM(d1 d2 'E1')
=

   If neither of the datasets exist you will be prompted accordingly.  You
   may enter wildcard dataset names to generate a dataset selection list
   for both datasets.

   By default, you will be prompted for any changes made to either datasets
   (with the exception of edit/view-replace changes) for your own
   protection.  You may disable/enable this feature by the use of the CHange
!                                                                     y
   command. For further details, refer below.

   Note: Watch members without stats, they may not produce the results you
!w       !
         want as in a full listing missing members and non-stats members
         will appear the same. The status of the members should be
         identifiable by the central indicator.

   In the table display, keep an eye on the Indians (red Indians), or at least
   the direction they fire their arrows in.
      <- Dataset #1 is the most recent version (note that stats may be
!y       !       t  !
         turned off for #2 and it may actually have more recent modifications).
!                       t !
      <= Dataset #1 is the most recent version as #2 does not exist.

      ** Both datasets are the same (according to date/time).
!y       !
      Note - The userid field will display the userid of the most recent
!w           !
             member.
           - If in doubt about any member, hit it with a 'C' to verify equality

             as members may be changed without the stats being updated.

   Valid commands:
     AO={'qualified.quoted.dataset' | * { /R }} | { E | V | B }

                  dataset if it already exists (uses original size).
                - You can pass a wildcarded dataset name to present a
!w                !
                  selection list.  If you use '*' by itself, your userid
!                                              g!
                  will be used as the hlq to bring up a dataset list.
                  (For this feature, you will need access to $DSNSEL and it's
!                                                            g      !

                  unconditionally for all members.
     Note: Watch the use of the above "copy all" commands as the actual

     ?D         - Dynamic tutorial.  This is the most up to date tutorial,
                  however, it does require access to HELPDRVR and it's
                  associated packaging.

   Selections take the format of 'cn', where 'c' is one of the following
!                                 yt!         y!
   selections and 'n' 1 or 2 for datasets #1 & #2 respectively. Any value

   other than 1 or 2 will default to 1.
   Valid selections:
     A  - Append TO member FROM the OTHER dataset.  Default is dataset #1.
!y      w!       w !                w     !                            t !
          "A2" means append member from dataset #1 to dataset #2.  Cannot

          append if either of the datasets are not catalogued.
     C  - Compare members. C2 will make dataset #2 the "new".

=y      w!
     B  - Browse member.
     E  - Edit member.
     D  - Delete member (will be prompted for confirmation). You cannot use
          the "D" function to delete members from uncatalogued datasets.
!              y!
     K  - bacKup member into member name suffixed by '#'. If the member name is

          '#'.  A confirmation panel will be displayed if the backup member

          already exists.  If this naming convention does not suit you either
          change variable "bup_suff" to your desired character or don't use this

          command and back up manually.

!y      w!                  t !   t !
=y      w!
     *  - Copy the latest version into the other dataset.
     =  - Repeat the last command.
     X  - Exclude member.  The entry is actually deleted from the table.
          Once excluded, it can only be brought back with a "Refresh"

!g
=y              w!
       MM       - This driver.
       MM$      - Reserved member list.

       $ALKHLQO o Generate HLQ based on SYSPREF and USERID.
       $ALKLOAD - Function to return load library containing "ALKLMDAT".
       $APPEND  o Append one member onto another (2nd. over 1st.).
       $COMPARE o CuperC driver with two datasets passed.
       $COPYMEM o Copy one member from a pds/dataset to another.
       $DSLIST  o Copy of IBM sample program IGGCSIRX for catalog searches.
       $WHOAMI  o Personalise user greeting.
       $ZTEMPF  o Allocate a temporary file. Required for the "PRNT" option.
       $BR      o Tutorial presenter in a browse session. (A must should
                  have.) If you see this in a browse session then it is
                  because of this, if not that's why you should get it.)
                  (This is usually an alias of the REXX "BR" function as a lot
                  of sites have a dataset browsing load module with the same
                  name.)
       $DATEMAN o Date manipulation routine.  Needed to update the table.
                  with dates when using the append feature. If you don't
                  append you don't need.
       CSMDSNCO o Cloning routine used for backups.
       HELPDRVR o Dynamic tutorial driver. Required for the most up to date
                  tutorial.  Refer to it for it's full packaging.
       SHOWSTOR o Called by "SLM". Refer to "SHOWSOR" for it's packaging.
       SLM      o Show Load Module loaded into memory using "SHOWSTOR".
                  Required for selection 'L' against load modules.
     Panels:
!g
       $DSNSELP o Dataset selection list panel.
       $MEMBBUP o Backup member name entry panel.
       $MEMBDEL o Delete verification panel. (Cannot delete without.)
       MMP      - Table display.
       MMPE     o Table display (for existing members) - EXIST command.
       MMPI     - Pop up window for Progress Indicator.
       MMPR     - Pop up window for change confirmation on reserved
                  members. Members set by "MM$".
       MMPU     - Pop up window for change confirmation.
     Load modules:
!g
       ALKLMDAT o Program to report on last modified dates for load modules.
                  The program is designet to list all programs link-edited
                  after an input date.  Date 010175 (format ddmmyy) is used
                  as a seed to ensure all programs are reported using a 2
                  digit year.

   GOTCHAs:

=y      !
     1. When comparing member lists between RECFM=U and F(ixed), do not use
        any of the synchronisation commands, for obvious reasons.  The copy
        attempt should return with a failed error message, however, certain
        site settings may attempt to bypass the error capture and attempt to
        copy, thereby causing a TSO/ISPF abend.
=r
  -> 2. For RECFM=U, the routine used does NOT process PDS/E's.  So don't
!e   y  r   e      r                       e  r        e    r       e
        come running to me saying this doesn't work if you persist in
        prcoessing PDS/E's.  STOP IT.  I'm sick of debugging things you have
!r                 e    r    e       r
        been warned about.
=y      !
     3. There may be site specific members that you may not wish to over- write
        or at least retain some form of control over it's process.  Use member
        "MM$" to provide a list of reserved members.  This list of members will
!        y  !                      r       !
        aumatically be scanned and if a hit is made, a confirmation panel will
        be displayed regardless of the change modification status setting.  If
        you don't like the prompt, modify (or get) "MM$" to return 'NULL' for
        your userid.
        Use this feature if you have received members and customised them and
        other sourced like member could cream your precious work.
     4. ISPF uses the '>' character as an intention to pass the command onto the
!y      !              y!
        application (in this case MM). It does this by detecting '>' as the
!                                                                 y!
        first character and passing the remaining characters to MM.  Depending
        on site settings this may occur for commands with a '>' as the first
!                                                            y!
        character and has been catered for in most circumstances.  When first
        using this facility at a site I suggest you experiment on test data.
        Try the '>...' command as is and if it does not do what is touted to
!                y   !
        happen, from this tutorial, slip a extra dodgy '>' in front and try
!                                                       y!
        again.
        Test first and ask later.
!g
        DO NOT, do first, test after and then scream for help later....
!e            r                               R     r
        It may be TOO late.
!r                e   r

     5. This facility is continually being upgraded.  I have found that
        subtleties in commands are missed due to monotone of help display.  The
        dynamic tutorial is colourised as such and being more beneficial, it is
        the official tutorial and many new features may be missed through use of
        this tutorial.  (However, the basic features are covered here.)
