  Good &TOD. &CNAME..

  &CM.: Receive XMITted data.

  This routine will issue the RECEIVE TSO command either implicitly to
  receive data XMITted to your node or explicitly against an XMITted
  destination dataset.

  When invoked without a parameter it will implicitly receive data XMITted
  to your node or if a dataset is supplied, explicitly against the passed
  XMITted destination dataset.

  If &CM. finds LRECL=1024 for the sequential dataset, it assumes it is a
  tersed dataset and will invoke "TT" (if available) to unterse it,
  otherwise an appropriate error message is displayed.  If "TT" is
  available, it will unterse the dataset to it's original DCB values into a
  datadset with '.UNTERSED' appended to the source dataset name (using
  "TT"s default settings).  This untersed dataset will automatically be
  deleted at termination.  For this to be meaningfull to &CM.,the original
  PDS should have been XMITted to a sequential file and that file tersed to
  a sequential LRECL=1024 dataset (or use the "TT" command to terse it).
  This untersed dataset will then be presented to the TSO RECEIVE command.

  Prior to processing the RECEIVE command, &CM. will create a
  self-extracted panel for output dataset processing. This panel will be
  deleted at end of processing.

  The panel will present 2 potential destination datasets:
    a) The original dataset name.
    b) The original dataset name without the hlq and a '.TEMP' suffix,
       unquoted to default to your SYSPREF setting.
  Either dataset may be overtyped/customised, however dataset "b" takes
  precedence and if "a" is to be use ensure "b" is erased.

  The allocation parameters are fairly staright forward, however, take care
  as no validation is performed and it will be accepted or rejected by the
  RECEIVE command's syntax checker. So don't allocate thousands of
  cylinders for a one lined single member PDS.

  Entry of "D" against the 'delete' prompt will delete any implicit XMITs.

  Under disp you can enter the following options:
    C - Compress the dataset prior to receiving into it.
    E - Empty the dataset. Deletes all exixsting members and compresses it
        before receiving into it.
    N - New dataset.
    O - Old dataset
    R - Replace dataset. Deletes the dataset before receiving into it
        (thereby re-creating it).
    S - Shared dataset.
