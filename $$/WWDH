 With the advent of the follow the sun principle it is nice to keep track of the
!                       6             b
 times around the world.  If you are a PC nerd and live for the WEB then read no
 further and hit your [END] PF key repeatedly untill you break the keyboard.
!                     y     b
 However, if you are a real person and love MVS, read further.

 As you may have noticed that a 3270 display is not quite as pretty as a Windows
 one and you may have trouble finding the borders of countries, but you can
 generally guess where things are.

 The display consists of the following feature:
!g
   1. Input field to change the current local time to whatever time you like.
!y    b
      Just tab to it and type. No wanky pull down menus.  Note, that this is a
      24 hour clock.
!y    w       b
   2. The first line contains a basic grid to zone the Atlas, relative to GMT
!y    b
      (which is zone 0).
!                    wb
   3. The second last line is the time in respective zones relative to the time
!y    b
      entered in point 1 above against your "home_zone". More on the "home_zone"
!                                            2        b               2        b
      later. A plus(+) in front of the time indicates that the time zone is one
!                   yb
      day ahead while a minus(-) signifies one day behind. Without a sign
!                             yb
      indicator, it is the same date zone as yours.
?home_zone
   4. The last line is an indicator of DayLight Saving (DLS). Zones with an '*'
!y    b                                yb yb    yb      y  b                 yb
      indicates that you have marked that zone subject to DLS.  The DLS
!                                                         y  b      y
      indicator with a   (reverse yellow block to indicate a full day of sun-
!                      Yb
      shine) is your current "home_zone". Home_zone subject to DLS will be
!                             G        b  2        b
      displayed as *. (Unfortunately individual DLS zones
!                  Yb
      zones have to be 'manually' defined. More on this later.)

 Controlling display:
!g
   1. Indicate a zone under daylight saving using any non-blank or '*' in the
!y    b                                                             yb
      appropriate column of the DLS indicator line.  You may remove DLS by
!                               y  b                                y   b
      typing 'N' in the column (blanking it out just removes the '*' but will
!             yb                w       b                         yb
      not adjust the time).
   2. You may change your current "home_zone" by placing the cursor in the
!y    b                            2        b                w      b
      desired zone and hitting [ENTER].
!                              y      b
      Notes: - This zone will be set to the value of the time field and, subject
!w             b
               to DLS, will radiate the times from it accordingly.
!                 y  b
             - Any zone subject to DLS will have 1 hour added to its time hence
!w             b                   y  b
               two adjacent zones can show the same time.
             - This change is only affective for the session.
!w             b
   3. You can make any marker your "home_zone" by entering "HOME" on the command
!y    b                             2        b              y   b
      line, place the cursor on the spotting "*" and hit [ENTER].
!                                             yb         y      b
      Note: - To make this permanent you will need to issue the UPDATE command
!w            b                                                 y      b
              (refer below).
   4. Alternatively, you can create member WWMYHOME at the top of your
!y    b                      w     b       p        b
      SYSPROC/SYSEXEC concatenation with the following contents:
!     t      bt       b
          /* REXX */ Return 'My_Home_City'
!g
      where " 'My_Home_City'," (note the leading space and trailing comma) must
!           y                 b
      be a city in the variable "cities" in the WW driver (refer below).
!                                t     b        y b
      The purpose of this feature is to prevent creaming your "home_zone" by
!                                                              2        b
      upgrades to the WW driver which may have another home.
!                     y b
      Note: - Without this member or misspelt city, the "home_zone" will revert
!w            b                                          2        b
              to defaults (1st. city in variable "cities").  The first match of
!                                                 t     b
              setting from WWMYHOME in variable "cities" will be used.
!                          p       b             t     b
   5. You can enter cities or landmarks on your map for quick reference. Note
!y    b             t      b  t         b
      that no validation is performed so you can place Sydney in Alaska if you
!                                                      t      b  w      b
      like and overlaps WILL overlap.  To place a marker on your map, enter the
!              w        b    w      b             t      b
      name on the command line and place the cursor within the map and hit
!     t    b                                 w      b
      [ENTER].  Imbedded spaces will be changed to '_'.
!     y      b                                      yb
   6. You can enter cities or landmarks using latitude and longitude.   The
!y    b             t      b  t         b     w        b   w        b
      format is "name(h.lat,lng)", where:
!                y              b
=y            w b
         name - any name.
         h.   - '+' for Northern hemisphere.
!y            w bgb     gb
                '-' for Southern hemisphere.
!y            w bgb     gb
         lat  - Latitute to the nearest minute.
         ','  - Seperator.
         lng  - Longitude to the nearest minute.
=
   7. You can remove markers/cities by entering "DELETE" on the command line,
!y    b              t      bt      b            y     b
      place the cursor on the spotting "*" and hit [ENTER].
!                                       yb         y      b
   8. Each marker has a "tail" pointing to the spot. To alter the length of the
!y    b                  y   b
      tail (the number of '-'s), enter "TAIL(n)" on the command line, where 'n'
!                          yb           y    gyb                             gb
      is the number of '-'s.
!                       yb

 Self modifying feature:
!g
   To activate this feature you will need to be editting your WW member and
!                                                             y  b
   issue command WW.  Note:
!                y b

   Once you have modified your DLS details, added/removed markers and tagged one
!                              y   b        w    bw       b           w      b
   as your home, enter "UPDATE" on the command line to activate the self
!                       y     b
   modification of this REXX program.
   The variable settings for "cities" and "ds_by_zone" will be updated to your
!      t        b             y     b      y         b
   new values and saved. The member will be presented on termination.  If you
   changed the "tail" value, variable "taillen" will be updated.
!               w   b                  t      b

   Notes: - The marker/city you tagged as "home" will be the first definition in
!w          b   t     bt   b               y   b
            the "cities" variable an will be used as the default home_zone.
!                t     b                                         2        b
            Every time you tag a marker as the "home" and issue the "UPDATE"
!                                               y   b                y     b
            command, it will be moved to the top.
          - If you are not editing the member and issue the UPDATE command the
!w          b                                               y      b
            first member found in the SYSEXEC or SYSPROC concatenation will be
!                                     w       b  w       b
            edited.  All changes will be lost and have to be re-applied.
            Furthermore, if you don't have update access, you will loose your
            changes.  You will be informed accordingly but it will be too late.
            Wont it?
          - By default all markers/cities are left justified.  If you add a
!                          t      bt     b
            marker/city and the length of the name combined with the "tail" is
!           t     bt   b                                              w   b
            too long to fit inside the left hand screen boundary it will
            automatically be left justified.  You can force any marker/city to
!                                                               t     bt   b
            be Right justified by using a parameter of /R (either case).
!              yb                                      y  b

   You can add/modify your own DLSs and markers.
!g
     1. For DLS, overtype any zone with a single numeric character.  To remove
!y      b   y  b
        DLS change the character to a 'N'. The zone equates have been set up
!y          b                          yb
        incrementally for easier manual reference.  (Variable is "ds_by_zone".)
!                                                                 t         b
     2. You can add your own markers by adding a word to the variable "cities"
!y      b                                                              t     b
        in the format "name,line#,column#{,R}".  You can append ",R" to force
!                      y                 by b                    y b
        right justification.

        Notes:
!w
        - both line# and column# must be a two digit number with leading zeros.
!w        b    w     b   w       b
        - line# is actually the field number in the map which ranges from 1-20.
!w        w     b                                                         w   b
          The first field is relative line number 4 when not in split screen
!                                                 wb
          mode. If you use the auto cursor placement feature all this is done
          for you.

   Summary of commands:
!g
=y            wb
     DELETE   - plus cursor to remove a marker.
     HOME     - plus cursor to mark a new "home_zone"
!y            wb                           2        b
                Note: If you use member WWMYHOME to tag your "home_zone" this
!w                    b                 p       b             2        b
                      command will update the WW driver and not WWMYHOME. You
!                                             y b               p       b
                      will need to cut/paste the top city (or whichever you
                      wish) into your member.
     NEW      - plus cursor to add a new marker called "CITYn", where n is
!y            wb                                        y   gb        gb
                the number of existing markers +1.
     TAIL(n)  - length of marker tail, where n is numeric.
!y        gy  wb                             gb
     UPDATE   - to  update the REXX routine with your changes.
     name     - plus cursor to add a marker. 'name' cannot be one of the above
!y            wb                              y   b
                values.
     name,line#,column#
!y
              - if you know your screen layout
     name(h.lat,lng)
