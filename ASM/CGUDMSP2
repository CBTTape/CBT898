`  Required fields are$Action, DDNAME, DSNAME`and$Disposition`.
`
$New allocation:
`  This option bypassed the need to free the dataset prior to allocation.
`  Required fields are$Action, DDNAME, DSNAME`and$Disposition`. With$New alloc
`  the old DSNAME is$freed`and the new one allocated (not subject to$realloc`).
`  Note, this operation may fail during the freeing stage if the dataset is
`  still open.
`
$Close:
`  This option will close the dataset.
`
$Open:
`  This option will open the dataset.
`
_NOTE -
`  While the$Remember`option is a useful facility, it uses up temporary storage
`  for each dataset deallocated and will not be deleted until the next
`  invocation of ADYN with$Remember=N`or the next COLD start of CICS.
