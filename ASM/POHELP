)F FUNCTION -

   PRINTOFF will print or punch one or more data sets to a sysout
   class that you specify. The data set must be a printable data set
   with a fixed or variable record length less than or equal to 256
   (255 if without carriage control).

)O OPERANDS -

))'dsname' or ('dsname_list')
          - This is the name of one or more data sets to be
            printed or punched.  The names should follow normal TSO
            data set naming conventions. If a list of data set names
            are specified, they must be enclosed within parethesis.

))CLASS(sysout_class)
          - SYSOUT class in which output is to be printed.  Default is
            CLASS(A). Certain restricted sysout classes (defined
            locally) will be rejected.

))COPIES(nnn)
          - Number of copies to be printed.  Default is 1.


))DEST(network_node)
          - Remote destination to which sysout data sets are to
            be routed. DEST(LOCAL) is the default.

))VOLUME(volser)
          - Volume serial that the pack resides on. Default is taken
            from the catalog (if dataset is cataloged).

))HEX     - Each record is printed in four lines. The first line is the
            normal data. The next line is the first nibble (left) of the
            hex representation of the above character. The second line
            is the secind nibble. The fourth line is a record seperator
            with easy column reference markings.
            NOHEX is the default.

))NOHEX   - Hex representation is not to be printed.
            NOHEX is the default.

))LIST    - If a partitioned data set is specified with no member name,
            then member names will to be listed.  This list will appear
            on the sysout class specified on the CLASS keyword.
            LIST is the default.

))NOLIST  - Member names are NOT to be listed.
            LIST is the default.

            NOTE: If both NOPRINT and NOLIST are specified,
                  your data set(s) WILL NOT be printed.

))PRINT   - Members are to be printed if a partitioned data set is
            specified without a member name.  PRINT is the
            default.

))NOPRINT - Members are NOT to be printed if a partitioned data set
            is specified without a member name.  PRINT is the
            default.

            NOTE: If both NOPRINT and NOLIST are specified,
                  your data set(s) WILL NOT be printed.

))FOLD    - Output is to be converted to upper case prior to printing.
            NOFOLD is the default.  Certain locally defined sysout
            classes will be forced to FOLD since lower case
            characters will not print on that particular printer,
            unless NOFOLD is explicitly specfied.


))NOFOLD  - Output is NOT to be converted to upper case prior to
            printing. This is the default.

))SEQ     - Sequence numbers are to be printd. This is the default.

))NOSEQ   - Printing of sequence numbers are to be suppressed.
            Only applicable for fixed length records < 252 bytes in
            length. SEQ is the default.

))HEAD    - Specifies that a header will be printed before the data
            set.  The header will include the data set name and the
            time and date that it was printed. This is the default.

))NOHEAD  - Specifies that no header will be written before the
            dataset/member. A header will still be produced before a
            member list if LIST was specified (defaulted).
            HEAD is the default.

     NOTE - If suppression is abandoned for one of the above reasons,
            no notice will be given at the terminal.
