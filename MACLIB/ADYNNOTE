     *   This routine saves and uses the following general registers:      *
     *      R1, R4, R5, R6, R7, R14 and R15.                               *
     *   If any of these registers are used as base registers or anchors   *
     *   for the DSECT containing the DATA format of the macro (if used),  *
     *   either substitute with an unused one (refer parameter 'Rn') or do *
     *   not use this macro.                                               *

     *   Parameters:                                                       *
     *       1. ACTION  - valid actions are:                               *
     *                    'Info'    - advise if dataset is allocated.      *
     *                                Requires the following minimum       *
     *                                parameters:                          *
     *                                  DD and DSN.                        *
     *                    'Alloc'   - allocate datest (basically pass jcl  *
     *                                format parameters).                  *
     *                                To reallocate, pass parameter of     *

     *                              - any one of these command will        *
     *                                unallocate the dataset/concatenations*
     *                    'DELete'  - delete allocates the DSN with        *
     *                                'DISP=(OLD,DELETE,DELETE)' then frees*

     *                    'Conc'    - concatenates the dd name defined on  *
     *                                the 'DDC' parameter to the 'DD' parm.*
     *                                                                     *
     *       2. BASE    - Register to be used as a base register for the   *
     *                    SVC 99 DSECT 'S99RBP'. This register must be     *
     *                    loaded with the address of the area where the    *
     *                    SVC 99 parameter list may be built. Also used to *
     *                    invoke the 'DYNALLOC' routine automatically.     *
     *                    (Do not enclose in brackets.)                    *
     *                    If the base parameter is not passed, the         *
     *                    following will need to be explicitly coded:      *
     *                    1. Before the invocation of the 'ADYN' macro:    *
     *                                                                     *
     *                         USING S99RBP,Rn  establish addresability    *
     *                                                                     *
     *                    2. On return from the macro:                     *
     *                                                                     *
     *                         LR    R1,Rn  req blk ptr in R1 for dynalloc *
     *                                      (both Rn must be same register)*
     *                         DYNALLOC                                    *
     *                                                                     *
     *       3. BLKSIZE - Block size. (Same restrictions as 'LRECL').      *
     *                                                                     *
     *       4. CCP     - Wheteher to make concatenation permanent.        *
     *                    Valid values are YES/NO with YES as default.     *
     *                                                                     *
     *       5. COPIES  - Number of copies to print (for SYSOUT DD's)      *
     *                                                                     *
     *       6. DATA    - Valid values are 'VARiable'/'CONstant'/'IBM'.    *
     *                    Set up the data fields if you use the parameter  *
     *                    'PARMT=DATA' in your program:                    *
     *                    Set to 'VARiable' if you want a map of the data  *
     *                    fields used for variable parameter passing. This *
     *                    is required in your getmained DSECT for re-      *
     *                    entrant programs.                                *
     *                    You may initialise this area by coding a macro   *
     *                    with 'DATA=CONstant' in your constant data area  *
     *                    and on the macro pass all the parameters as      *
     *                    though you were coding a macro with 'PARMT=PARM' *
     *                    and moving it over the variable part. The max    *
     *                    length of the data is 123 bytes.  If the program *
     *                    is not re-entrant you only need to code the macro*
     *                    with the parameter of 'DATA=VARiable'.           *
     *                  In all cases supply a macro with 'DATA=IBM' to     *
     *                    define the IBM required macros. If this is not   *
     *                    defined in your program, you must explicitly     *
     *                    define the following ibm macros in your program  *
     *                          'IEFZB4D0'                                 *
     *                          'IEFZB4D2'                                 *
     *                  There should only be 1 macro with DATA=IBM/VAR     *
     *                    however you may have as many DATA=CON as you     *
     *                    like. DATA=IBM/VAR generate labels while 'CON'   *
     *                    does not.                                        *
     *                                                                     *
     *       7. DD      - DD name to be allocated. In case of a 'Conc'     *
     *                    action, concatenate the 'DDC' parm to this.      *
     *                    If parameter 'DDR=YES' is used with 'PARMT=PARM' *
     *                    this paramater must point to a variable name in  *
     *                    the data area.                                   *
     *                                    - or -                           *
     *                    DD=(varname) if the DDname is to be taken from   *
     *                    a variable.                                      *
     *                                                                     *
     *       8. DDC     - DD name to concatenate to DD name with 'Conc'.   *
     *                                                                     *
     *       9. DDR     - DD name to be returned and placed in the variable*
     *                    specified for the 'DD' parameter after an        *
     *                    'Alloc' request without a DD parm. Set to either *
     *                    YSE/NO ('NO' is the default).                    *
     *                    If 'PARMT=DATA' is used, the DD name is returned *
     *                    in the variable 'YDD' which would have been      *
     *                    defined by the ADYN macro with 'PARMT=VAR'.      *
     *      10. DEST    - Printer-id destination with 'SYSOUT'             *
     *                                                                     *
     *      11. DISP    - Standard JCL type DISP parameter, eg.            *
     *                    'DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)'                        *
     *                    (default of 'OLD' for 'Allocate' action.)        *
     *                    For new dataset allocation without a 'DSN='      *
     *                    but rather a 'DSNR=' parameter, the 2nd. and 3rd.*
     *                    disposition parameter will be automatically      *
     *                    changed to '(....,DELETE,DELETE)'.               *
     *                                                                     *
     *      12. DSN     - DSNAME (unquoted of course) or '*' for terminal. *

     *                    Variable name to return the DSN name in, after an*
     *                    'Info' request. (If 'PARMT=DATA' is used the DSN *
     *                    will be returned in the variable 'YDSN' which    *
     *                    would have been defined by the ADYN macro with   *
     *                    'PARMT=VAR'.)                                    *
     *                                    - or -                           *
     *                    If the action is ALLOC and the dataset name is   *
     *                    stored in a variable and PARMT=PARM is required, *
     *                    indicate the variable's name by specifying       *
     *                    'DSN=(varname)'.                                 *
     *                    NOTE - This variable must be specified if the    *
     *                    'DSNR=Yes' parameter is used. Use 'DSN=YDSN' for *
     *                    'PARMT=VAR'.                                     *
     *                                                                     *
     *      13. DSNR    - DSN name to be returned and placed in the        *
     *                    variable specified for the 'DSN' parameter after *
     *                    an 'Alloc' request without a DSN parm. Set to    *
     *                    either YES/NO ('NO' is the default).             *
     *                    If 'PARMT=DATA' is used, the DSN name is returned*
     *                    in the variable 'YDSN' which would have been     *
     *                    defined by the ADYN macro with 'PARMT=VAR'.      *

     *                    data area. MF=L defines 16 full words as a       *
     *                    register save area (will not be defined if the   *
     *                    area has already been defined by a prior macro). *

     *                    DD name without having to free it.  The macro    *
     *                    will generate the Free statements prior to       *
     *                    Allocation. Set to YES/NO ('NO' is the default). *

     *                           ignored and you must specify the RLSE=YES *
     *                           paremeter.                                *

     *      30. UCLOSE  - Unalloc dataset on closing. If this option is to *
     *                    be effective, it must be coded as UCLOSE=YES for *
     *                    both types of parameter passing as there is no   *
     *                    equivalent data area.                            *

     *                    in the variable 'YVOLSER' which would have been  *
     *                    defined by the ADYN macro with 'PARMT=VAR'.      *

     *      A) Macro format parameter of 'MF=.' Is mandatory.              *
     *         A macro with 'MF=L' is required in your program to generate *
     *         a register save area as registers R1,R4,R5,R6,R7,R14,R15 are*
     *         used in the program. All registers except R15 will be       *
     *         reset on return from the macro. R15 will contain the return *
     *         code from the 'DYNALLOC' routine.                           *
     *                                                                     *
     *      B) If parameter 'PARMT=DATA' is used:                          *
     *         Must issue an 'ADYN' macro with 'DATA=VARiable'. For re-    *
     *         entrant programs, suggest you initialise the data area in   *
     *         your DSECT by copying over it data initialised in your      *
     *         constant area from an 'ADYN' macro using 'DATA=CONstant'.   *
     *                                                                     *
     *      C) Must have 'DATA=IBM' to include the IBM DSECTs needed for   *
     *         SVC 99.                                                     *
     *                                                                     *
     *      D) Space requirements:                                         *
     *         Allow 300 bytes for SVC 99 parameter list, (ie. data area   *
     *         pointer to by the 'BASE' parameter).                        *
     *         Allow 123 bytes for both constant and variable data area    *
     *         created by the 'DATA=CON/VAR' parameter. Add 64 (16 x 4)    *
     *         bytes if this expansion stores the register save areas      *
     *         (refer to the MF parameter).                                *
     *                                                                     *
     *      E) On the EXEC form of the macro, R15 contains the return code *
     *         from the 'DYNALLOC' routine.  R0 contains the error code in *
     *         the high 2 order bytes and the information reason code in   *
     *         the low 2 order bytes.  All the other registers wiil be     *
     *         reset to their initial value on entering the macro.         *
     *         NOTE - Note the comment about register usage in this macro  *
     *                versus your program's register usage.                *
     *                                                                     *
