CBT tape potential contribution

Hi Sam,

I was forced into retirement about 2 years ago and am happily
enjoying woodworking in my spare time though miss the $$$$s.
Just recently I got a tad nostalgic and thought that it would be
a shame to let my 35+ years of experience as an appo and sysprog
slide into the bit bucket.

My experience covered close to 20 years of contracting where I've
had contracts for long and short periods at small and large sites
(including IBM and CSC).  Consequently I have amassed a swag of
both handy (and not so handy) routines that I cannot pass on to
an understudy/apprentice.  Because of the multiple site support I
often had to update my routines as I aimed for generic or easily
customisable solutions. As a result I have developed the nasty
habit of placing everything into one dataset for the ease of
moving that big one around.  I have kept names unique so the
dataset contains all my REXX, CLIST, Panels, Skeleton and Message
members and a few occasional doco etc..  I do keep a separate
dataset for the load library (however, if only 1 or 2 module have
changed  I often XMIT that member(s) into an FB=80 dataset and
store that as a member in the above catch all and ship).   I hate
typing and as it is a catch all I call it 'userid.$$' so it is at
the top of the DSlist under 3.4 and readily accessible).   I
identify each member in the $$$INDEX member with a brief 1 line
description and with my LINEMAC commands readily edit members
from that $$$INDEX member.   This $$ dataset is allocated at the
front of all the respective ISPF/SYSEXEC concatenations.

I would like to make my knowledge and toils available to all so I
am offering the following in the attached ZIP file.

The individual datasets are XMITted  and called,

$$.XMIT        - non-load module executable  (good start is the
                 $$README and the $$$INDEX as further reference).

$LOAD.XMIT     - load modules

DSECT.XMIT     - DSECT maps used for control block mapping by my
                 memory navigator routine and on-line disassembler.

ASM.XMIT       - All the assembler source for load module used
                 except for those off the CBT (and PDSEDIT
                 supplied by Fuji back in 1981   and still
                 working like a charm for text scans and global
                 changes).

MACLIB.XMIT    - Contains macros used in assembler programs

DB2.UTILS.XMIT - Examples of REXX commands to execute functions
                 on DB2 database provided by some 3PP that may be
                 useful to DBAs.

I have extracted  the $README and $$$INDEX and attached them
separately for your (or whoever) info.  The $README content is
circa Jan 2011 when I was going to make a subset of the better
routines (hence the ALLIN1 references), however, never eventuated
past the doco with my untimely redundancy and the changes made
since (today) have been cosmetic blatant spelling/grammar
corrections, however, it should give an indication of the
highlights and my humble order of preference.  You can see from
the list of datasets that the source and loadmods have been
XMITted to their own datasets in this packaging.

Not sure if this format is acceptable or not for the CBT, or you
will tweak it or I should re-package it, however, I haven't MVS'd
for over 2 years, so walking on water is OK but the ISPF editor
and TSO/MVS commands would be a challenge.

I have no objection in anyone contacting me by phone or email.
I can assist with most queries, however, heavy debugging and
customising would be a tad too taxing.
