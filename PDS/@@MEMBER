          A NOTE ABOUT DISPLAYING MEMBER NAMES IN TAPEMAP
          - ---- ----- ---------- ------ ----- -- -------

We often use the TAPEMAP program from CBT Tape File 299, to show
what member names are in each file on the CBTTAPE.

Some files on the CBT Tape contain XMIT-format pds'es, and TAPEMAP,
which can show embedded pds members in IEBUPDTE-format pds members,
CAN NOT SHOW member names embedded in XMIT-format pds'es that are
also pds members.  Therefore, in order to show member names in an
XMIT-format pds, I have included an extra member which just contains
the member names in IEBUPDTE format.  TAPEMAP can read those, and
will display the names that are really in the XMIT-format members.

EXAMPLE:

Member ASM is an XMIT-format pds containing assembly source code,
 but you don't know what member names are in the pds.

So, member ASMMEM is a list of all the member names in member ASM,
 without the data, but it is in IEBUPDTE format, so that TAPEMAP
 can show those member names when you TAPEMAP the file.
